Install a Scheme implementation. [Guile] Scheme is recommended, as it is widely available and cross-platform. Also, it's the primary Scheme implementation used to build the examples. It's also a very useful Scheme to have in your toolbelt, as it's the official GNU extension language.

#### On OS X

Install via Homebrew:

```bash
brew install guile
```

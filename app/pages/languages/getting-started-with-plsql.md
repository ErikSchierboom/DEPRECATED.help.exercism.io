## Installation

You'll need access to a mounted Oracle DB. If you don't have one already
installed, here are a few options:
* get a free workspace at https://apex.oracle.com
* download VirtualBox from Oracle and run one of the freely
available images; at the time of writing, the easiest to get started with
at the time of writing might be _Database App Development VM_. The
image is quite large...
* download and install the a version of the Oracle DB itself. Developer licenses
are free.

## Running Tests

The command to execute the tests for each problem will be part of the test
file. To run the test, you need to be connected to a mounted Oracle DB.

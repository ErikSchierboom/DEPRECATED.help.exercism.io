# Exercism.io End-User Documentation

**LEGACY**

**_We are no longer accepting pull requests to this repository._**

This site is still up on help.exercism.io, but we're moving the
language-specific documentation and incorporating it into the
/languages/:track_id pages on exercism.io.

The contributor-specific documentation has been incorporated
into the contributing guide in exercism/x-common

We will be moving the documentation about the general exercism.io
process ("how it works" and "troubleshooting") into the main
exercism codebase.
